## Level 0 Hello Ethernaut

A contract's ABI exposes all of the public methods. Looking at the contract's ABI will give insight into what functions on the contract can be called.

### Solution

Launch the instance from the ethernaut website and copy and paste the new contract's address in the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` variable

Generate a new instance on the ethernaut website

The level is to introduce you to interacting with a contract while viewing the contract's ABI.
I have created a solution which shows the methods which are called in order to yield the solution to complete the level.

Once you have run ./scripts/0.ts then submit the instance on ethernaut

Refresh the ethernaut page and you are done! ðŸŽ‰
