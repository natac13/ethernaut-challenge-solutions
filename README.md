# Ethernaut Challenges

## Setup

- Metamask
- Rineby Testnet

## Level 0 Hello Ethernaut

A contract's ABI exposes all of the public methods. Looking at the contract's ABI will give insight into what functions on the contract can be called.

Test Ether is needed and can be obtained at [this facuet](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby)

### Solution

Generate a new instance on the ethernaut website

The level is to introduce you to interacting with a contract while viewing the contract's ABI.
I have created a solution which shows the methods which are called in order to yield the solution to complete the level.

Once you have run ./scripts/0.ts then submit the instance on ethernaut
